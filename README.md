# letsencrypt-cli (for node.js)

CLI for node-letsencrypt modeled after the official client.

* Free SSL Certificates
* 90-day certificate lifetime
* One-off standalone registration / renewal
* On-the-fly registration / renewal via webroot

## Install Node

For **Windows**:

Choose **Stable** from <https://nodejs.org/en/>

For Linux and **OS X**:

```
curl -L bit.ly/iojs-min | bash
```

# Install LetsEncrypt

```bash
npm install -g letsencrypt-cli
```

## Usage

These commands are shown using the **testing server**.

Want to use the **live server**?

1. remove the `--server https://acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org/directory`
2. or change it to `--server https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory`

**Note**: This has really only been tested with single domains so if
multiple domains doesn't work for you, file a bug.

### Standalone

You can run standalone mode to get a cert **on the server** you will be
using it for over ports **80 and 443 (or 5001)** like so:

```bash
letsencrypt certonly \
  --agree-tos --email john.doe@example.com \
  --standalone \
  --domains example.com,www.example.com \
  --server https://acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org/directory \
  --config-dir ~/letsencrypt/etc
```

Then you can see your certs at `~/letsencrypt/etc/live`.

```
ls ~/letsencrypt/etc/live
```

This option is great for testing, but since it requires the use of
the same ports that your webserver needs, it isn't a good choice
for production.

### WebRoot (for production)

You can specify the path to where you keep your `index.html` with `webroot`.

For example, if I want to get a domain for `example.com` and my `index.html` is
at `/srv/www/example.com`, then I would use this command:

```bash
sudo letsencrypt certonly \
  --agree-tos --email john.doe@example.com \
  --webroot --webroot-path /srv/www/example.com \
  --config-dir /etc/letsencrypt \
  --domains example.com,www.example.com \
  --server https://acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
```

Note that we use `sudo` because in this example we are using `/etc/letsencrypt`
as the cert directory rather than `~/letsencrypt/etc`, which we used in the previous example.

Then see your brand new shiny certs:

```
ls /etc/letsencrypt/live/
```

You can use a cron job to run the script above every 80 days (the certificates expire after 90 days)
so that you always have fresh certificates.

## Test with a free domain

```bash
# Install Daplie DNS
npm install -g ddns-cli

# see terms of use
ddns --help

# agree to terms and get domain
ddns --random --email user@example.com --agree

# the default is to use the ip address from which
# you can the command, but you can also assign the
# ip manually
ddns --random --email user@example.com --agree -a '127.0.0.1'
```

Example domain:

```
rubber-duck-42.daplie.me
```

## Run without Root

If you'd like to allow node.js to use privileged ports `80` and `443`
(and everything under 1024 really) without being run as `root` or `sudo`,
you can use `setcap` to do so. (it may need to be run any time you reinstall node as well)

```bash
sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep /usr/local/bin/node
```

By default `node-letsencrypt` assumes your home directory `~/letsencrypt/`, but if
you really want to use `/etc/letsencrypt`, `/var/lib/letsencrypt/`, and `/var/log/letsencrypt`
you could change the permissions on them. **Probably a BAD IDEA**. Probabry a security risk.

```
# PROBABLY A BAD IDEA
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /etc/letsencrypt /var/lib/letsencrypt /var/log/letsencrypt 
```
